	<strong>
	<p>One legend says that the Jade Emperor needed to choose 12 animals as palace guards.</p>
	<p>The Cat asked his neighbor Rat to help him sign up. Rat forgot, which is why they became mortal enemies.</p>
	<p>At the palace, Ox was first in line, but Rat secretly climbed onto Ox's back and jumped in front of him.</p>
	<p>Tiger and Dragon thought it was unfair, but they could only settle behind Ox.</p>
	<p>Rabbit found it unfair too. He wanted to race with Dragon and succeeded.</p>
	<p>This angered Dog, who bit Rabbit in a fit and was sent to the back as punishment.</p>
	<p>Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey and Rooster fought amongst themselves as well.</p>
	<p>Pig came late, after everything was finally settled, and could only be the last.</p>
	<p>Of course, this is only a story. Cats didn't even exist in China when zodiac animals first came about. </p>
